# Portfolio - ecommerce:-website-vs-mobile
This project is part of the "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning" course I enrolled in.

In this project we explored the dataset from an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions.

Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. After exploring the data and building a linear regression model, we performed a regression analysis of the coefficients in order to find the answer we need to provide the company with.
